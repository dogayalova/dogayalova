# Hello, I'm Doğa Yalova! 👋

## About Me
I'm an undergraduate student with a strong background in **Molecular Biology and Genetics**. With significant experience in computational and structural biology, I'm passionately transitioning towards the more coding-intensive aspects of **Bioinformatics**.

## My Journey
- 🧬 **Molecular Biology & Genetics**: My foundational field of expertise, offering a deep understanding of genetic systems and biological mechanisms.
- 💻 **Computational & Structural Biology**: Having gained substantial experience in this area, I have developed a keen interest in the computational modeling and analysis of biological structures.
- 🖥️ **Bioinformatics**: Currently, I am steering my career towards bioinformatics, focusing particularly on the development and implementation of bioinformatics algorithms and tools.

## Collaborations and Projects
- 💞️ I am keen to collaborate on projects that combine bioinformatics with advanced coding techniques. I'm especially interested in applying and expanding my programming skills to solve complex biological problems.
- 🤝 If you're working on innovative bioinformatics projects and need someone who can bridge molecular biology with coding expertise, I'd love to contribute.
